Test answer 

Assumption:
EC2 instance created and accessible from ansible host via ssh

How to use:
specify host and connection in /etc/ansible/hosts
run playbok as
ansible-playbook test-nginx.yml

Notes:
It was required to use lightweight image and Alpine was used
https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/

The ansible script consists of 2 roles:
docker - installing docker on EC2
nginx - building image with nginx and started container

site folder contains:

Dockerfile - for image/container
index.html - "Hello world" page
nginx.conf - nginx configuration
htpasswd - basic nginx authentication ( user / haufe)


My example:

[root@ip-172-31-38-170 nginx]# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
aad0770785df        nginx-test          "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   nginx-test
[root@ip-172-31-38-170 nginx]# curl -u user:haufe http://127.0.0.1/
